            <h1>LOOPJOY&trade; GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE</h1><br/>
            <p>THESE GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE ("TERMS") APPLY TO ANY
PURCHASE(S) YOU ("YOU," OR “YOUR”) MAKE THROUGH (I) THE LOOPJOY IN-APP
SOFTWARE (THE “SOFTWARE”) MADE AVAILABLE BY LOOPJOY LTD. ("LOOPJOY," “WE,” “US”
OR “OUR”) THROUGH CERTAIN MOBILE APPLICATIONS (EACH, AN "APP") AND/OR (II)
THE LOOPJOY ONLINE STORE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE LOOPJOY WEBSITE AT
WWW.LOOPJOY.COM OR THROUGH ANY OTHER ONLINE MEDIA OPERATED BY LOOPJOY
(COLLECTIVELY, THE “ONLINE STORE”).
THE SOFTWARE AND ONLINE STORE ARE
INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE "SERVICE". BY PURCHASING A
PRODUCT ("PRODUCT") THROUGH THE SOFTWARE OR THE ONLINE STORE, YOU SIGNIFY
YOUR CONSENT TO (I) THESE TERMS; (II) LOOPJOY'S PRIVACY POLICY (AS DEFINED
BELOW). ANY PURCHASE YOU MAKE BY USING THE SOFTWARE OR ONLINE STORE IS ALSO
SUBJECT TO THE LOOPJOY TERMS OF USE AVAILABLE AT: WWW.LOOPJOY.COM/LEGAL/
TOS.</p>

<p>1. Ability to Purchase. You may only make a purchase through the Service if you are over the
age of 13. If you are between 13 and 18 years of age, then you must review these Terms with
you parent or guardian before making your purchase to make sure that you and your parent or
guardian understand these Terms and agree to them.</p>

<p>2. Products. LoopJoy takes commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with accurate Product
information. However, LoopJoy does not warrant that the Product information or any other content
on the Service is accurate, reliable, complete or error-free. Should a Product that you purchase
appear to not conform to the Product information provided as part of the Service’s order process
("Order Process"), your sole remedy is to return the Product(s) in unused condition as set forth in
Section 5 below.</p>

<p>3. Shipping.</p>

<p>3.1. Pricing and Expected Delivery Times. Shipping prices may vary depending on the Product's
weight, the shipping method, the destination, and other factors. Expected delivery times may
vary depending on the Product, its availability, the shipping method, the destination and other
factors. The shipping prices and expected delivery times for each Product may vary from time
to time based on market conditions. LoopJoy shall not be liable for any delay in delivery of
the Product(s).</p>

<p>3.2. International Shipping. Due to economic embargoes or restrictions, we may be unable to ship
to some countries. In the event we are unable to ship to your country, you will be notified by
email that your order has been canceled, and you will not be charged, or if you have already
been charged, you will be refunded for the price of the Product. Orders may be subject to
sales tax, import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country or state,
as well as delivery delays due to required customs clearance procedures. You acknowledge
and agree that any such charges or delays are your sole responsibility and under no
circumstances shall LoopJoy accept any responsibility or liability for such charges.</p>

<p>3.3. Notification. Following your completion of the Order Process and successful processing of
the applicable payment, a confirmation will be sent to you by e-mail. LoopJoy shall have no
obligation to ship the Product(s) until you have paid in full, and such payment is final and
approved.</p>

<p>4. Payment. If you choose to purchase a Product, you agree (i) that we, or one of our service
providers (such as PayPal) ("Third-Party Service Provider") may charge your credit card for the
purchase and such other amounts (including shipping fees and any taxes, as applicable) that may
accrue in connection with the purchase; (ii) to only provide valid and current information for (a)
yourself; or (b) another person, but only if you have first obtained their express consent to do so;
(iii) that we may use the tools, software or services of Third-Party Service Providers, to process
transactions on our behalf and that you shall review and be bound by the terms of use and privacy
policy of any such Third-Party Service Provider and hold us harmless, and expressly release us,
from any and all liability arising from your interaction with any such Third-Party Service Provider; and (iv) except as set forth in these terms, all purchases are final and non-cancellable or non-
refundable.</p>

<p>5. Return Policy</p>

<p>5.1. You have the right to return a Product you have ordered in the event of a material defect in
the Product or its nonconformance to the Product description provided as part of the Order
Process. In order to return a Product, you must first contact LoopJoy at returns@loopjoy.com
to request a return number, and then send us the Product in unused condition, along with
the applicable return number and the packing slip or e-receipt, within fourteen (14) days from
the delivery of such Product. LoopJoy will send you a replacement Product within reasonable
time from LoopJoy's receipt of the returned Product and confirmation that it has been
returned in unused condition, or, if LoopJoy determines in its sole discretion that replacement
of the Product is not commercially reasonable, LoopJoy or its Third Party Service Provider
will credit your credit card for the price of Product only (exclusive of any shipping or taxes).</p>

<p>5.2. Solely in the event LoopJoy is required by the laws applicable in your jurisdiction to offer
refund or return rights in addition to those set forth in Section 5.1, LoopJoy will provide such
remedies as required pursuant to such laws and, where permitted, LoopJoy may elect to
provide one or more alternative remedies.</p>

<p>6. Intellectual Property Rights. All IP Rights (defined below) in the Products remain the property
of LoopJoy or our licensors. You agree not to remove, modify, obscure, or add to any trademarks,
service marks, or logos ("Marks") accompanying or featured on the Products and acknowledge
that such Marks may be protected by applicable copyright or other intellectual property laws and
treaties. "IP Rights" means any patents, trademarks, registered designs and all applications for
registration of them, copyrights or design rights or any right which is similar or analogous to any
of these. You may not resell any Product, or any portion of a Product, without the explicit written
consent of LoopJoy.</p>

<p>7. Warranty Disclaimers. SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OUR RETURN POLICY AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE, THE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED
ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, AND THOSE ARISING BY STATUTE OR FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR
USAGE OF TRADE.</p>

<p>8. Limitation of Liability. LOOPJOY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT,
EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES UNDER THESE TERMS OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THE SALE AND USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, ANY PRODUCT. THE TOTAL AGGREGATE
LIABILITY OF LOOPJOY FOR ANY DAMAGES UNDER THESE TERMS OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THE SALE AND USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE PRODUCT, SHALL IN NO EVENT
EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR SUCH PRODUCT<p>

<p>9. Privacy. We will use any personal information that we may collect or obtain in connection with
your purchase in accordance with our privacy policy, which is available at www.loopjoy.com/legal/
privacy ("Privacy Policy"). You agree that we may use personal information that you provide or
make available to us in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>10. General. These Terms shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the
state of New York, United States, and Purchaser consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of the United States federal and state courts of the state of New York, and you waive
all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens. You hereby irrevocably
waive all right to trial by jury. If any provision of these Terms shall be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, such holding shall in no way affect or impair the remaining provisions, and the
parties shall use their reasonable efforts to substitute valid and enforceable provisions which have
the closest meaning and purpose as those so held. These Terms and the Privacy Policy set forth
the entire understanding between you and LoopJoy concerning your purchase of the Products,
and may not be modified except in a writing signed by LoopJoy. Failure of a party to enforce any of the provisions of these terms will not be construed to be a waiver of the provision, and no
waiver of any rights hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of the same or other right on any
other occasion. YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION THAT YOU MAY HAVE ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR PURCHASE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR
AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS
PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
